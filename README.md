This is the readme file.
Backend resources for the "SmartAlarm" skill for Amazon Alexa.

<<<<<<<<<< NOT YOUR USUAL ALARM CLOCK >>>>>>>>>>

"Alexa, postpone my alarm"
"Alexa, PLEASE STOP"
"Alexa, i wanna sleep"
Who doesent say this sentences to alexa every morning when the alarm clock starts ringing?
I actually do, and sometimes is not helpful that Alexa listens to me, because i HAVE to wake up
to not be late at work.

This is why i've designed and built this skill.
With this skill, your echo will not stop ringing until you solve a problem or answer a question!
This is the time to take extreme measures to fight your lazyness.

<<<<<<<<<< STILL ON DEVELOPEMENT >>>>>>>>>>

First languages which will be implemented:
- Italian
- English

First type of problems which you will have to solve:
- Math
